# Stroke Relief Project Overview

This project contains the 3 projects I ended up creating for PRJ400 while in my 4th year of college. Below is an overview of each project

## [Project 400](https://github.com/PsychoHacks/StrokeRelief/tree/master/Project400)

This is the first verison of the mobile application, running Ionic 3. This version is outdated and feature imcomplete. It is not recomended to run this version of the application as dependencies are likely to be outdated and will cause security issues. All of the pages and functionality was carried over to Project 400 Version 4.

## [Project 400 Version 4](https://github.com/PsychoHacks/StrokeRelief/tree/master/Project400Version4)

An updated version of the mobile application, using Ionic 4. Should be mostly up to date and has more capbilites than Project 400.

## [Project 400 Web Portal](https://github.com/PsychoHacks/StrokeRelief/tree/master/Project400WebPortal)

The Web Portal used by doctors running Angular 8. Should be up to date with packages and should compile.
